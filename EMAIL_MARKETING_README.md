## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Emails not sending**: Check SendGrid API key and account status
   - Ensure `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is set in `api/.env`
   - Verify domain is verified in SendGrid and sender identity approved
   - For local testing without real sends, start the API with `DEV_BYPASS_ADMIN=true` to access admin endpoints, and consider using SendGrid sandbox mode or test endpoints above which do not mutate totals
2. **High bounce rate**: Clean email list and verify addresses  
3. **Low open rates**: Improve subject lines and send times
4. **Gift cards not sending**: Verify Tremendous API credentials and funding

### Monitoring

- Check email logs in the database for delivery status
- Monitor SendGrid dashboard for account health
- Review automation execution logs in server console
- Use analytics to track performance trends

## Security

- All email marketing endpoints require admin authentication
- For local testing only, you can set `DEV_BYPASS_ADMIN=true` in the environment to bypass admin checks. Do not use in production.
- API keys should be kept secure and rotated regularly
- Use HTTPS for all webhook endpoints
- Monitor for unusual activity in email sending patterns
