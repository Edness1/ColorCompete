## API Endpoints Working:

- `GET /api/badges` - ✅ All badges
- `GET /api/badges/user/:userId` - ✅ User badges
- `POST /api/badges/user/:userId/check` - ✅ Manual badge checking
- `POST /api/badges/initialize` - ✅ Initialize default badges

## How it works:

1. **User submits artwork** → Automatic badge check triggered
2. **Contest winner announced** → All participants checked for badges
3. **Badge criteria met** → Badge automatically awarded to user
4. **UserProfile page** → Displays earned badges in Achievements tab

The system is now fully functional and will automatically award badges as users participate in contests! 🚀
